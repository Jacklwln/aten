Fixed - Some action slots were still referenced in the code. Fixed - Settings was hiding the ModelsList rather than ModelsListWidget. Added CreateFragment option to context menu. Fixed - Widget slots for several functions were incorrectly named and thus broken. Added option to enable viewing by patern to the AtomsTable. Added BuildFragmentsPopup and removed old Fragments dock widget.
