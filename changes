Rearranged all panels in main UI to be same layout style. Fixed - Messages scroll had inverted controls. Added basic buttons to Forcefields panel. Removed commands for line tolerance and convergence criteria, instead adding them as optional arguments to minimisation commands. Removed local variables in command/minimise.cpp. Updated Aten::openInclude() and Aten::openPartition() function to take fileName and name arguments, and used them when opening all includes and partitions. Renamed 'dontPushTree' argument in program generation commands to 'pushTree' to avoid confusion, and adjusted values throughout. Added ForcefieldsAssignPopup and ForcefieldsMinimisePopup.
