**Aten** can make use of MOPAC (any version) if it is installed correctly on your machine.  All that is required is for the path to the binary to be set in the program preferences, along with a suitable temporary directory in which the calculations will run.  Either go to the **External Programs** tab in the **Preferences** window (**Settings→Preferences**).
