**Aten** is maintained entirely by T. Youngs. However, many people have contributed useful thoughts, ideas, bugfixes, and motivation to the project over its lifetime. These people are, in no particular order:

A. K. Croft and crew (Mac afficionado, supreme fault-finders)

S. Cromie (algebraic guidance)

A. Elena (bug-finder extraordinaire, ‘pathological case’-locator, Windows / Mac building and packaging)

D. Pashov (Windows / Mac building and packaging)

S. Norman (icon judgment)

N. C. Forero-Martinez and M. Smyth (bug finding, bug finding, and bug finding)
