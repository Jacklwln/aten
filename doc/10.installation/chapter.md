## Packaged Versions <a id="packages"></a>

The easiest way to get **Aten** is, of course, to download a precompiled installer for your system. Installers are available for Windows, Mac OS X, and some Linux distributions in the [downloads](/aten/downloads) section. Some old legacy versions can still be found at the [OpenSuSE Build Service](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/trisyoungs/).

## Linux Repositories <a id="repositories"><a/>

Coming soon (probably!).

## Compilation from Source <a id="compilation"></a>

If you want to compile **Aten** by hand (e.g. if youâ€™re keeping your own copy of the source and updating it from [GitHub](https://github.com/trisyoungs/aten)) then these guides may help. They are very general and (unavoidably) quickly go out of date, but they should provide some info to at least get started. The Windows method is entirely different and somewhat more complicated than for Linux and Mac OS X, but a working approach is documented here.
