# Messages Window

  <caption>Messages Window</caption>

The messages window is simply that – a place for all of **Aten**’s text output to appear when the GUI is active. All error messages are printed to the messages window – if something doesn’t work as you expect it should (or, indeed, doesn’t work at all) there is usually a clue or, better, an explanation somewhere in the messages displayed here.

Sometimes messages will be printed which have the appearance of [u]hyperlinks[/u] – these can be clicked on to perform various simple tasks on the model, relevant to the accompanying message.
