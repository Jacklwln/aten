# Trajectory Window

If a trajectory is associated to the current model, the trajectory window allows to skip through frames and playback the trajectory.

The trajectory view button serves to act as a toggle between displaying the actual trajectory frames and the parent model which ‘owns’ those trajectory frames. Its state is linked to the **Trajectory→View Model** and **Trajectory→View Trajectory** menu items of the main window, and vice versa. The set of standard playback controls allow individual frames to be skipped, as well as going straight to the beginning or end of the trajectory. The current frame may also be set with either the spin control or slider at the foot of the window. The delay between swapping of frames is controlled by the slider on the right where the delay can be set in milliseconds. Note that the actual speed of playback will also depend on the size of the system being viewed and the raw power of your graphics card.
