# Cell Definition Window

Allows the user to edit the unit cell specification of the current model, assign a crystallographic spacegroup, and perform spacegroup packing according to the spacegroup. Whether or not the current model possesses a unit cell is determined wholly by the **Has Cell** checkbox – if checked, the current model is periodic, if not, then it is an isolated collection of atoms.

If the model has a cell, its size and shape can be set in one of two ways. The primary method is though direct editing of the cell matrix on the **Matrix** page, which presents the individual components of the X (A), Y (B), and Z (C) axes. All values are in Angstroms, and any changes made here are immediately applied to the current model. Alternatively, the cell may be set by entering its lengths (in Angstroms) and angles (in degrees) on the **Define/View ABC** page and then pressing the **Define** button.

The spacegroup assigned to the current model can be changed and removed on the **Spacegroup** page. On its own, an assigned spacegroup is just a number - no modifications to the atoms are made by changing the assigned spacegroup. Packing of atoms, however, is a different matter. Once a spacegroup is assigned, symmetry-equivalent atoms may be generated by use of the **Pack** button. This assumes that the current contents of the model represents the symmetry-unique set of atoms (i.e. the minimal generator set which, along with the spacegroup and unit cell, defines the entire crystal).
