# Geometry Window

Simple measurements of distances, angles, and torsions between picked atoms or the current selection of atoms is possible from the measure toolbar.

Distances, angles and torsions between atoms can be measure here – select the desired tool on the left-hand side and click the relevant number of atoms one-by-one in the main window. Alternatively, select a molecule or group of atoms for which you wish to measure all (bound) instances of a certain type of geometry, and press the corresponding button on the right-hand side. To clear all measurements from the current model, press the **Clear All** button.

The **Distance**, **Angle**, and **Torsion** pages of the Geometry window allow the specific geometry of a set of selected atoms to be set. Simply select, for example, two atoms from a model (note that they do not have to be connected by a bond) and set or adjust their distance from here. When choosing the **Set Bond Length**, **Set Bond Angle**, and **Set Torsion Angle** items on the atom context (or **Selection**) menu, the Geometry window is automatically presented on the correct page for the number of selected atoms.
