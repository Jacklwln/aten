### New

Create a new, empty model

### Open

Load an existing model from disk.  Long-pressing shows the recent files menu.

### Save

Saves the current model, overwriting its existing file.  Long-pressing allows access to any filter **Options** that are available for the current file save format.

### Save As

Saves the current model under a different filename.

### Close

Closes the current model, saving any changes first to the existing file (or, optionally, a new file if no there is no existing filename).

### Session

The **Session** button allows access to Session control, loading and saving.  A 'session' represents all the data currently loaded and displayed in **Aten**, including models, forcefields, grids etc.  **Clear**ing the session will remove all loaded data, and return **Aten** to a state resembling a fresh start-up. Session files (`*.asf`) can be **Load**ed and **Save**d to allow quick return to a set of seecific models, views etc. See the topic on [Sessions](/aten/docs/topics/sessions) for a more in-depth description of the data contained in a session, and exactly what is saved in `asf` files.
