Partitions (or 'partitioning schemes') are used in the [Disorder Builder](/aten/docs/gui/disorder) to allow target molecules to be restricted into specific volumes in space, providing a means to define arbitrary functions by which to determine these volumes.

**Aten** comes with a set of basic partitioning schemes, located in the `partitions` directory of the [main data directory](/aten/docs/installation/data). User-defined partitions can be placed in the [user data directory](/aten/docs/user/location).
