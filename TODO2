TODO
====
Remove automatic loading of scripts on startup.
Reimplement KeepNames functionality.
Crash if model is saved, then filters reloaded, then model is saved again (since filter pointer will be wrong)?
Scale molecule COM inverts coordinates??
Implement optional startup 'guide' or 'wizard' that will disable all controls on the GUI and explain what means what, highlighting them as appropriate.
Remove dialog pointers (use instances instead).
Fix callbacks for atom picking etc.
Octahedral Growing doesn't work.
In AtenWindow::on_actionFileSaveImage_triggered convert options to proper QDialog.
o Change SaveImageDialog to check for empty image filename, and disable OK button accordingly.
Fix image saving - in particular scaling & offset when saving large image (what role will/did ViewLayout play?)
Clear selected measurements on panel popup clears all measurements.
CRASH - Click in empty space in model list causes fp exception. Related to no current model selected.  Force ListWidget to always have one selected?
Recent files list - enable load on double-click, settings not loaded/saved properly?
TMenuButton - after (long-) click to show popup, allow popup to be hidden with no actions if the button is clicked on again.
Check - is using redirected filenames really necessary when saving movie frame images?
Automatically adjust grid size for number of visible models, based on current aspect ratio and context size etc.
Click to select grid.
Redo ProgressIndicator, making into a class much like QProgress (can't just use QProgress, since we want to have progress indicator functionality in the CLI....). Make it clever enough to realise that the gui is visible or not. Perhaps integrate it into Messenger, so that messages printed out while the indicator is running don't disrupt the indicator?
Implement checkbox for secondary grid on/off.
Sort out remaining icons!
Command prompt doesn't update main view after running command?

Graphics TODO
=============
In top-left corner of main window, have a black icon illustrating which mode is active (except for Interact).
Have small, additional black icons at top-right of each model window, illustrating whether it has been modified, is displaying trajetory frames, etc.
Optimise basic primitives to use vertex/index arrays instead of just vertices (also check end caps of spheres).
Check picked atom rendering (probably broken).
Optimise primitive drawing / generation by allowing use of GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP?
Reimplement drawing of grid (volume) axes.

Possible TODO
=============
Add in calculation of quantities and graphing?
Instead of a separate AtenVariable, make Aten subclass Variable?
Move Prefs from being a static global to a member of Aten?
Make ElementMap store reference to Aten, preventing passing of FFs?
Make UserActions a member of something (Viewer?).
Reformulate Pattern::bondEnergy() and others into a separate class, since the Pattern class shouldn't really own them.
Make Model::EnergyStore a private member with accessor?
Add ObjectLists (when using CHECK)?
Remove global MC, CG, SD declarations, and put them in Aten?

GUI TODO
========
AddAtom functionality (from old Build menu).
Context Menu:
o Set Colour doesn't work, since it needs a colour selector popup.
Build option - keep centred.
Remove TColourFrame (after updating Prefs and Glyphs windows).
When messages display is on top, pass wheel event onto MessagesScroll.
Button to calculate / show total charge in selection.
Allow right-click on elements in PTable to set as member of common elements popup.
Finish Spacegroup popup.
Add Calculate tool to work out centre of geometry/mass.
Add option to display ColourScale selector (e.g. for Grid colour buttons)
Have Tools page? With, for instance:
--- Plot Orbital (raising dialog from old GridsWidget)
Reimplement Open Expression somewhere.

Manual TODO:
Remove level of detail and transparency options from Prefs.
More examples (e.g. slab generation)
Remove 'gui' keyword.
Remove 'calcEnergy' optional args from scaleMolecules and scaleCell.
Remove replaceChars (after command is removed).
Remove frameCurrent* from Prefs accessors.
Added SetAngles, SetDistances, and SetTorsions commands.
Add GridStyleSecondary command (GridStyle now explicitly for primary surface).
Change enum entries for Grid::SurfaceStyle.
Add GridOutline and GridPeriodic commands.
Rename (De)SelectFor to (De)SelectCode.
Remove ManualSwapBuffers from Prefs accessor.
growAtom / selectionGrowAtom - add optional parameter "bool bond = true".
Remove LineTol and Converge commands, and update minimisation command signatures (inc return values).
Remove prefs options for replicate, and add extra options to turn on folding and trimming to replicate() command.
