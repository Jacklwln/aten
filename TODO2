TODO
====
Undo/Redo:
  * Rework UndoEvent to use an enum and stored data rather than an individual class for each event type?
  * Add Grid-related undo/redo (e.g. title changes, colour etc.)
  * Add undo/redo for atom colour setting
Trajectory handling:
o Inherit generates a crash when at first frame??
Intelligent Select - add support for selection by type name (e.g. O*, OW etc.).
Add set members to Matrix class allowing axes to be set from atoms in models.
Crash when tree selecting large models (recursion overflow?) - use array-based loop instead.
Add specific line primitive class that allows chunking (for speedup of stick rendering, because otherwise an enormous array is continually deleted'd/new'd).
Add 'Reload' options to Grid context menu.
Add context menu "Copy" and "Set" to TColourButtons.
Add 'Relative' view lock option, alongside 'None' and 'Lock' (Follow)?
Miller selection.
Progress indicator jobs in GUI appear to be created even if they are short and not 'ready' to be shown yet.
Implement 'factory' for common objects such as Atom & Bond, to save new'ing all the time (esp. for large systems).
Panel for User tools, essentially loaded from scripts (plugins?) in a user's tools/X directory.
Visualise toolbar, containing Glyph management, polyhedra etc.
Polymer builder.
Collapse cell tool.
Tool to calculate / show total charge in selection.
Calculate tool to work out centre of geometry/mass.

Plugin TODO
===========
POVray export.

Graphics TODO
=============
Optimise basic primitives to use vertex/index arrays instead of just vertices (also check end caps of spheres).
Optimise primitive drawing / generation by allowing use of GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP?
Reimplement drawing of grid (volume) axes.
Frame individual model areas when displaying multiple models OR light checkerboard background?
Automatically adjust grid size for number of visible models, based on current aspect ratio and context size etc.
Multiple bonds (double, definitely) are not drawn correctly, becoming squashed as the bond length increases.
Scaling factor for labels etc. (popup slider in gui)

GUI TODO
========
Sort out remaining icons!
Add option to display ColourScale selector (e.g. for Grid colour buttons)
Add Plot Orbital to Tools page (raising dialog from old GridsWidget)
Add manual typing popup / context menu?

Possible TODO
=============
Implement optional startup 'guide' or 'wizard' that will disable all controls on the GUI and explain what means what, highlighting them as appropriate.
Add in calculation of quantities and graphing?
Reformulate Pattern::bondEnergy() and others into a separate class, since the Pattern class shouldn't really own them.
Make Model::EnergyStore a private member with accessor?
Add ObjectLists (when using CHECK)?
Click to select grid.

Manual TODO
===========
Examples: Partitioning (torus), advanced selection (caffeine nitrogens, transmutation etc), chloroform glyph triangles, CG particles.
Sections: ExportFilm (GUI)
TestSelect command.
Setting of filter options when using --batch CLI mode (in 03.cli/batch).
