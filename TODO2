TODO
====
Undo/Redo:
  * Rework UndoEvent to use an enum and stored data rather than an individual class for each event type.
  * Add Grid-related undo/redo (e.g. title changes, colour etc.)
Rename commands for consistency - e.g. newFF to newForcefield?
Ato export format is incorrect if nrestraints == 0 (i.e. for single atoms) since newline is not printed.
Plugin Implementation
o DL_POLY trajectory cannot be properly loaded without a model containing the correct atoms - add the ability to create a local, temporary model in the filter, and store atom information in this in the readHeader() function. Then could update modelTemplate to take a model pointer as an optional argument. Does this mean we should rewrite the language to properly use pointer specifications?
o Better detection of correct format - i.e. search function broken (e.g. in GAMESS filter).
Trajectory handling:
o Inherit generates a crash when at first frame??
Intelligent Select - add support for selection by type name (e.g. O*, OW etc.).
Add set members to Matrix class allowing axes to be set from atoms in models.
Printf command buffered output is never printed if no newline ever occurs.  Need to store data somewhere other than the Printf function itself, and flush it at the end of command execution.
Crash when tree selecting large models (recursion overflow?) - use array-based loop instead.
Add specific line primitive class that allows chunking (for speedup of stick rendering, because otherwise an enormous array is continually deleted'd/new'd).
Add 'Reload' options to Grid context menu.
Add context menu "Copy" and "Set" to TColourButtons.
Add 'Relative' view lock option, alongside 'None' and 'Lock' (Follow)?
Miller selection.
Intelligent Select: prepended '+' is interpreted as NETA.
Progress indicator jobs in GUI appear to be created even if they are short and not 'ready' to be shown yet.
Speedup Disorder Builder??
Implement 'factory' for common objects such as Atom & Bond, to save new'ing all the time (esp. for large systems).
Panel for User tools, essentially loaded from scripts (plugins?) in a user's tools/X directory.
Visualise toolbar, containing Glyph management, polyhedra etc.
Add About::plugins() window.
Clash with --plugindir Qt option on CLI?

Graphics TODO
=============
Optimise basic primitives to use vertex/index arrays instead of just vertices (also check end caps of spheres).
Optimise primitive drawing / generation by allowing use of GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP?
Reimplement drawing of grid (volume) axes.
Make main view background and text/overlay colour aware of Qt widget colouring style.
Frame individual model areas when displaying multiple models OR light checkerboard background?
Automatically adjust grid size for number of visible models, based on current aspect ratio and context size etc.
Multiple bonds (double, definitely) are not drawn correctly, becoming squashed as the bond length increases.

GUI TODO
========
Need to shrink used button space when window is not large enough to display all widgets in panel.
Sort out remaining icons!
Colour Selector:
o Need widget that is ebeddable as a QMenuAction* (for atom context menu)
o Need simple button class (essentially a specific TMenuButton for ColourPopup) for Glyphs popup etc.
Button to calculate / show total charge in selection.
Add Calculate tool to work out centre of geometry/mass.
Add option to display ColourScale selector (e.g. for Grid colour buttons)
Add Plot Orbital to Tools page (raising dialog from old GridsWidget)
Add manual typing popup.

Possible TODO
=============
Implement optional startup 'guide' or 'wizard' that will disable all controls on the GUI and explain what means what, highlighting them as appropriate.
Add in calculation of quantities and graphing?
Reformulate Pattern::bondEnergy() and others into a separate class, since the Pattern class shouldn't really own them.
Make Model::EnergyStore a private member with accessor?
Add ObjectLists (when using CHECK)?
Click to select grid.

Manual TODO
===========
Examples: Partitioning (torus), advanced selection (caffeine nitrogens, transmutation etc), chloroform glyph triangles, CG particles.
Sections: ExportFilm (GUI)
TestSelect command.
Setting of filter options when using --batch CLI mode (in 03.cli/batch).
Switch / Case.
More descriptions / examples for Disorder Builder options.
--noplugins and --atenplugins CLI switch.
Removed --pack, --bond, --centre, and --fold CLI switches.
ATENPLUGINS environment switch.
Whole plugin thing, really!  And make filters section defunct.
Removed FinaliseModel/Grid commands, and all read/write commands related to files.
